## Controller of MVC for Talent Acquisition Exploration Platform

Our goal was to organize MIMS students to allow for greater ease in acquiring the right talent!
Whether you be a school administrator, recruiter, or fellow student looking for the right skills or the right matches between people.

## Useful commands
> select_intersect(collection, Java, Python, C, CPP, R, D3, SQL)

Where the collection is the Object containing the collection of student representations. The other values are booleans, True to select for this skill, False to ignore.

> same_career_goals(collection, name)

Name is the person who our target is and output will be all students who have listed the same career goals.

> find_tfidf_sim(collection, name, N, options=None)

Name is our target, N is number of outputs, option can be set to 'verbose'.
This will return the N most similar students to our target. When options set to 'verbose', this will also return the corresponding cosine similarities calculated. This uses the term frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency method of calculating similarity between target and entry.

> find_tfidf_dis(collection, name, N, options=None)

Same as above, but instead the N most dis-similar students.

> find_sim_partners(collection, name, N, options=None)

Again, name is our target, N is number of outputs, option can be set to 'verbose', with the same results as above.
However this time, we are not using the tf-idf method and instead do a direct cosine similarity calculation with all columns except for context columns (0-5). All columns have a maximum value of 1 normalized against the target row. Specific interpretations for each column and choices in normalization can be found in commented code.

> find_dis_partners(collection, name, N, options=None)

Same as above, but instead the N most dis-similar students.



## Future Implementation

* Build Flask UI for web deployment
* Add D3 visualization for social graph and metric distributions
* Auto-convert pdf files to csv row entry
* Allow independent users to update their row entry
* Track changes over time for users for their career journey, give suggestions
* Allow users to give feedback on usefulness of suggested collaborators, contrast weighing schemes
* Auto-generate groups given size of group and amount of difference between members

## Other To Dos

- Apply tfidf to raw of pdf document
- Add ability to apply non-one weights to findpartners feature sets
- Convert select_intersect to use JSON string as input
